## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- JS



### What I learned

I have learned how to toggle classes in order to hide or show an element. I've also practiced a bit the positioning of the elements.  This time I used a simple structure for the SASS, just one file, as there were one main component on the challenge.

Regarding JS, at first I've used a conditional  construction to hide/show the share tooltip, but it didn't have a smooth transition, so I used a class toggle instead and played with opacity, which allows smooth transitions.


### Continued development

For future projects I want to try to position the tooltip based on the mouse position, not on some fixed values.
